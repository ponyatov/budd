\secrel{Further Reading}

A good introduction to the concepts of simulation can be found in (Maryanski
80). A more theoretical treatment is given in (Zeigler 76). The definitive
description of the Smalltalk-80 language (Goldberg 83) illustrates many more
extensive simulations in Smalltalk. Other programming languages designed
forsimulation include Simula (Birtwistle 73), Demos (Birtwistle 79), and GPSS
(Greenberg 72). The algorithm for computing the normal distribution is taken
from Knuth (Knuth 81, Vol. 2). A large collection of references to computer
games and simulation exercises is found in (Gibbs 74).
