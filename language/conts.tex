\secrel{Comments and Continuations}

A pair of double quote marks (II) are used to enclose a comment. One
must be careful not to confuse the double quote mark with two adjacent
single quote marks CI), which look very similar. The text of the comment
can be arbitrary and is ignored by the Little SmaIItalk system.

The Little Smalltalk system assumes that each line typed at the terminal
is a complete SmaIItalk expression. Should it be necessary to continue a
long expression on two or more lines, a special ineJication must be given
to the Little SmaIItaik system to prevent it from misinterpreting the partial
expression on the first line and generating an unintentional error message.
This special indication is a backwards slash C""-) as the last character on
all intermediate lines, for example:
\begin{lstlisting}
    2 +     \
    3 * 7   \
    + 5     \
40
\end{lstlisting}
