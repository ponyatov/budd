\secrel{Getting Started}

You now have enough information to try getting some hands-on experience
using the Little Smalltalk system. After logging on, type the command st.
After a moment, the message "Little Smalltalk" should appear, and the
cursor should be indented by a small amount on the next line. If, at this
point, you type in a Smalltalk expression and hit the return key, the expression will be evaluated and the result printed. Try typing "3 + 4" and see
what happens. The result should be a 7, produced at the left margin. The
cursor then should advance to the next line and once more tab over several
spaces. Try typing "5 + 4 sqrt." Can you explain the outcome? Try "(5 +
4) sqrt."

Try typing
\begin{lstlisting}
i <- 3
\end{lstlisting}
Notice that, since assignment expressions do not have a value, no value
was printed. However, if you now type
\begin{lstlisting}
i
\end{lstlisting}
the most recent object assigned to the name will be produced.

The name last always contains the value of the last expression computed. Try typing
\begin{lstlisting}
27 + 3 sqrt
\end{lstlisting}
followed by
\begin{lstlisting}
last
\end{lstlisting}
