\secrel{Primitives, Cascades, and Coercions}\secdown

This chapter introduces the syntax for cascaded expressions and describes the notion of primitive expressions. It illustrates the use of
primitives by showing how primitives are used to produce the correct
results for mixed mode arithmetic operations.

\secrel{Graphics}\secdown

Although graphics are not fundamental to Little Smalltalk in the same
way that they are an intrinsic part of the Smalltalk-80 system, it is still
possible to describe some graphics functions using the language. This
chapter details three types of approaches to graphics.

\secrel{Processes}\secdown

This chapter introduces the concepts of processes and semaphores. It
illustrates these concepts using the dining philosophers problem.
